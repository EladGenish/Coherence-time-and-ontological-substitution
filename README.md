Author’s Note
This note accompanies Coherence, Time, and Ontological Substitution.
The aim of this paper is not to dispute the mathematical consistency or empirical usefulness of coherence-based or information-theoretic approaches to emergent time. Many such frameworks are elegant, productive, and technically sound.
The critique here is narrower and more foundational: it concerns ontological independence.
Specifically, the paper argues that when coherence, information, or relational order is treated as a primitive generator of time, multiple conceptually independent structures (state space, metric, ordering principle) are implicitly assumed rather than derived. In these cases, time is not eliminated from the ontology but re-encoded under a different label.
This is a critique of a class of assumptions, not of any single model or author. The intention is to clarify where genuine emergence ends and reparameterization begins, and to encourage greater precision when foundational claims are made.
The arguments here are compatible with operational and computational frameworks (including coherence-based engines and benchmarks) so long as those tools are treated as descriptive substrates, not ontological primitives.
